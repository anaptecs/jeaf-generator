# Stereotype `«HeaderParam»`
Stereotype `«HeaderParam»` is used to mark that a parameter of a REST operation should be taken from the http header. Please be aware that the stereotype can only be applied on an operation of an interface that is marked as `«RESTResource»` and the operation is marked as `«RESTOperation»`.

| **Stereotype**          | `«HeaderParam»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Parameter` `Property`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `value`   | `String` | Name of the http header field from which the parameter value should be taken. |
| `technicalHeader`   | `Boolean` | If a header field is marked as a technical header then it will be part of the published API e.g. in the OpenAPI specification. However it will be hidden to the generated business code. |
