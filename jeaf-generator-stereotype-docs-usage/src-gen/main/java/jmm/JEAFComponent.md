# Stereotype `«JEAFComponent»`
Stereotype `«JEAFComponent»` is used to define JEAF Components in the UML model. JEAF Generator will use this stereotype as marker to identify for which model elements JEAF-specific classes for components should be generated.

Please be aware that all settings will applied for all services that are implemented by the component.

| **Stereotype**          | `«JEAFComponent»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Component`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `transactionBehavior`   | `TransactionBehavior` | Attribute is used to define the transaction behavior of the component. Possible values are: `NOT_SUPPORTED`, `SUPPORTS`, `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`, `MANDATORY` and `NEVER`. <br>Default value is `REQUIRED`. |
| `layer`   | `Layer` |  |
| `useJEAFSecurity`   | `Boolean` | Attribute defines if JEAF Security should be used for this component. Default value is `true`.<br><br>For further details about JEAF Security please refer to [JEAF Security](https://anaptecs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JEAF/pages/546210729) |
