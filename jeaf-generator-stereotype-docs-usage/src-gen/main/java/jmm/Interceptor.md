# Stereotype `«Interceptor»`
Stereotype `«Interceptor»` is used to mark classes as an interceptor. Interceptors will be called before and after a service invocation. As they tend to have a strong impact on the behavior of a component / service it’s recommended to already add them to the UML model.

Stereotype `«Interceptor»` is JEAF Framework specific.
