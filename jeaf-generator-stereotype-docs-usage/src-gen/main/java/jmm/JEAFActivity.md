# Stereotype `«JEAFActivity»`
Components use activities to implement non-trivial functionality of the services they offer. Activities are used to structure the internal dynamic aspects of a component. JEAF Generator will create an interface and an empty implementation class for every activity in the UML model that is marked with stereotype `«JEAFActivity»`.

<br>

| **Stereotype**          | `«JEAFActivity»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Activity`        |
| **Tagged Values**       | `none`           |
