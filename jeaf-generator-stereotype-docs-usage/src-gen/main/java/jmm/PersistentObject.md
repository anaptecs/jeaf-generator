# Stereotype `«PersistentObject»`
Stereotype `«PersistentObject»` can be used to define all information needed to map a class to a relational database using Java Persistence API (JPA). 

<br>

| **Stereotype**          | `«PersistentObject»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Class`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `classID`   | `Integer` | The `classID` is a global ID for persistent objects. It is used e.g. for mapping of inheritance hierarchies to databases in object relational mapping. The `classID` is maintained and managed manually and must be unique within the whole UML model. <br><br>JEAF Generator will check and ensure it’s uniqueness and will produce an error if this constraint is not met. It’s recommended to work with value ranges for for Class-IDs if your model becomes a little larger. |
| `table`   | `String` | Attribute defines the name of the table that is used to store objects of this class in a database. If the attribute is not set then the not qualified name of the class in upper case letters will be used.<br><br>Please be aware of specific length and keyword restrictions depending on the used relational database. |
| `optimisticLock`   | `Boolean` | Attribute defines the locking behavior of the class. If the attribute is set to `false` then no locking will be used. In case of `true` optimistic locking is enabled.<br><br>Default value is `true`. |
| `OIDRowName`   | `String` | Optional attribute can be used to define the name of the row that is used to store the so called Object-ID (OID). The OID is the object oriented equivalent to a primary key on the database.<br><br>If the attribute is not set then the globally configured default value of JEAF Generator is used. |
| `VersionLabelRowName`   | `String` | Optional attribute can be used to define the name of the row that is used as version label for optimistic locking.<br><br>If the attribute is not set then the globally configured default value of JEAF Generator is used. |
