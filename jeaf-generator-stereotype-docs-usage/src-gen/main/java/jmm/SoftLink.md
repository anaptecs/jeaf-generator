# Stereotype `«SoftLink»`
So called soft links are a mechanism to decouple objects within your application. From a model perspective there is just a directed association between 2 classes of your model. But as the association end is marked as soft link using stereotype `«SoftLink»` in the generated code there will be just a proxy type e.g. a String representing the ID of the object and not a direct reference to the class.

| `softLinkType`   | `SoftLinkType` | JEAF Generator supports the following types for soft links: `String`, `long`, `Long` and `CustomGenericType`.<br><br>In case of `CustomGenericType` the actual type has to be defined as configuration parameter for JEAF Generator in the Maven Configuration. This way you can define your own types. |
