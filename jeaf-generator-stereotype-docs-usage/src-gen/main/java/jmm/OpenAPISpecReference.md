# Stereotype `«OpenAPISpecReference»`
When creating an OpenAPI specification there might come up situations where you rather want to publish multiple smaller specification artifacts then one larger one. 

JEAF Generator supports such modularization as it supports to define dependencies between OpenAPI specifications. For such cases you can define dependencies between OpenAPI specifications in the UML model. These dependencies need to be marked with using stereotype `«OpenAPISpecReference»`.

| **Stereotype**          | `«OpenAPISpecReference»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Dependency`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `location`   | `String` | Optional location where the dependent specification is available. If the location is not defined then the referenced OpenAPI specification file is expected to be located in the same directory.<br><br>It is also possible to define an external (public) URL. |
