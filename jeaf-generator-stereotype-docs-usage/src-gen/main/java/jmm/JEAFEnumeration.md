# Stereotype `«JEAFEnumeration»`
Stereotype `«JEAF Enumeration»` can be used to model enumerations that should be generated by JEAF Generator.

JEAF Generator also supports so called "extensible enums". From a semantic versioning perspective added new literals to an enumeration is a breaking change. However in reality this is a quite common case. If you want to avoid the breaking change then you can work with extensible enums. By default for them its not considered to be a breaking change if you add an additional literal.

To support developers in this scenarios JEAF Generator is able to generate extensible enums. In Java, they have an additional fallback literal to which unknown literals will be mapped during JSON deserialization.

| **Stereotype**          | `«JEAFEnumeration»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Enumeration`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `extensibleEnum`   | `Boolean` | If set to `true` the enumeration is an extensible enum.<br><br>Default value: `false` |
| `hasCustomImplementation`   | `Boolean` | If set to `true` then a so called code protection region will be generated. Inside this region custom code for the enum can be added. JEAF Generator will detect such regions and will preserve the code inside.<br><br>Default value: `false` |
