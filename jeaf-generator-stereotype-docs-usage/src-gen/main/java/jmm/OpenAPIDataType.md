# Stereotype `«OpenAPIDataType»`
Stereotype `«OpenAPIDataType»` can be used to have a strong typing in Java and d flat representation in OpenAPI specification / JSON.

During serialization the "real" Java object will be converted into a primitive JSON representation e.g. a String. During deserialization the other way round. This helps to have nice JSON representation (not nested objects with just one property) and also have real types in Java.

| **Stereotype**          | `«OpenAPIDataType»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Class`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `inline`   | `Boolean` | Tagged value defines if all occurrences of the type should be inlined in the OpenAPI specification or if a explicit type should be created. |
| `compositeDataType`   | `Boolean` | There are cases where you want to have a type that consists of more than one property in Java but still just a flat JSON representation. In this case you can mark you class as so called composite data type. <br><br>This allows to have multiple properties on it. |
