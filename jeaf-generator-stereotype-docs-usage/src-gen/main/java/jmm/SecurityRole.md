# Stereotype `«SecurityRole»`
According to [JEAF Security](https://anaptecs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JEAF/pages/546210729) the authorization to call a specific method of a service will be grouped to roles for better maintainability. JEAF Generator support to defines roles already in the UML model.

Therefore actors in the UML model can be annotated with stereotype `«SecurityRole»`.
